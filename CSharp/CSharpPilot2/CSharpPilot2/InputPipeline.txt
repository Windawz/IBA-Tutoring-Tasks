A better way to implement the input pipeline would be the following:

The InputInfo type. Holds all necessary information about input.



The Source type. Represents a source of input from which the
information required by InputInfo can be obtained.

The Request type. It takes a Source and provides a means
of requesting input from it.
It will have several derived types that customize the
way the input is requested.

The Requester type. It takes a Source and a Request.
The point is, to get input, the game code refers only to it.
